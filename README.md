# Llama vs DeepSeek: Model Comparison

## Project Overview
This repository compares Llama and DeepSeek (free) models on coding tasks using both one-shot and multi-shot prompting strategies.

## Implementation
The code integrates with both model APIs using authentication keys to send identical prompts and collect responses for comparison. No additional explanation or processing was added to the raw model outputs.

## Key Features
- Direct API integration with both models
- One-shot prompting evaluation
- Multi-shot prompting with examples
- Side-by-side output comparison
- Performance analysis across different coding tasks

## Usage
1. Add your API keys to the configuration files
2. Select testing parameters
3. Run the comparison scripts
4. View the results in the output folder

## Future Work
- Expand test cases and programming languages
- Add quantitative code quality metrics
- Test additional prompting techniques
